📌 Project Overview
This project aims to determine the optimal location for an airline hub in the United States based on flight demand, distance, and passenger traffic. The goal is to identify the most profitable location for a hub investment by analyzing air traffic data and economic viability.

The study follows a two-stage approach:
1️⃣ Data Collection: Extracting relevant data on flight routes, passenger traffic, and airport locations.
2️⃣ Optimization Analysis: Determining the most strategic hub based on distance-cost assumptions and revenue models.

🎯 Objectives
Find the best location for an airline hub that maximizes profitability.
Analyze flight demand and passenger traffic to different destinations.
Evaluate the economic impact of distance on ticket pricing and airline revenue.
Use data-driven modeling to support decision-making in airline network planning.
🗂️ Dataset
Source: Data collected from United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and United States Department of Transportation.
Features:
Airport locations
Flight routes and distances
Passenger traffic volume
Cost per passenger based on distance
Special Considerations:
Data is filtered for US domestic flights.
The model assumes that longer flights generate higher revenue per passenger.
⚙️ Technologies & Tools
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
🐼 pandas – Data processing
📊 matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
🌍 geopandas, folium – Geospatial analysis
🏗️ scipy.optimize – Optimization modeling
🏙️ shapely – Geospatial computations
🚀 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Extracted flight route data from relevant sources.
Cleaned and structured the data for analysis.
Geocoded airport locations using latitude/longitude.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized flight density maps to identify major air traffic corridors.
Analyzed passenger volume per airport to detect high-demand regions.
Correlated flight distance with revenue potential.
3️⃣ Optimization Model
Formulated a profitability model based on:
Distance-to-cost ratio
Passenger volume at each location
Applied mathematical optimization to rank potential hubs.
4️⃣ Key Results & Insights
Identified top candidate locations for the airline hub.
Evaluated the trade-offs between operational costs and revenue generation.
Proposed recommendations for hub placement strategy.
📊 Key Findings
Top 3 optimal locations identified for an airline hub.
Long-haul routes contribute significantly to higher revenue per passenger.
Strategic location selection can optimize airline profitability.
🛠️ Challenges & Limitations
Data limitations: Some datasets may have missing or incomplete records.
Assumption dependency: The model is based on simplified cost-revenue assumptions.
External factors: Variables such as fuel prices, airport fees, and competition are not considered in this study.
